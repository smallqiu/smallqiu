<font color="#470194">Hello there, welcome to "Small Qiu"! The person behind this is me, or mm, and...mm is a seventh grader (she/her) but by the time you see this, she is probably in eigth grade. She is best at competition math, and is surprisingly decent at sports and piano even though she never practices either of those. This purplish color is the only color she likes which you can still read the words in-- her other favorite color is a super light red-ish pink-ish color which is the background color of this website.</font>

<h2>MM & Math</h2>
MM's first IMO problem is, if she remembered correctly, is the 2004 IMO #1 Geometry problem courtesy to her summer program AMSP. MM likes math but she decided that 
<ul>
	<li>She doesn't want to try out all the student-run comps if they're are at midnight</li><br>
	<li>She prefers to spend time on her own organization (GmathIRL) instead of others even though she still helps them</li><br>
	<li>She doesn't quite fit into intensive programs that are weeks long yet somehow she likes intensive programs that are year long because after a few weeks she doesn't reallly notice how they are "intensive", if such a thing exists...</li><br>
	<li>She is having trouble creating another item for this list</li>
</ul>
In terms of math experience she passed the alcumus on all the NT, Alg, C&P, and Geo topics in ~two weeks (without school) and then stopped grinding alcumus. She also qualified for AIME in 6th grade but what's more notable might be that she was 1 point from AMC8 DHR in 4th grade.

	<button>this is addicting</button>

<h2>MM & gMathirl</h2>
GmathIRL is an organization that MM found-ed with(?) Serena? Or maybe what's easier to say is GmathIRL is an organization where MM is the vice-president or something. Anyways GmathIRL is awesome and please visit it's website <a href="gmathirl.webflow.io">here</a>. Currently we are looking for people to <ul>
	<li>Help organize our math club</li>
	<li>Donate</li>
	<li>sign up for GAME</li>
</ul>
<h2>MM & Music</h2>
MM is working on three pieces of music right now, her favorite one is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMYUEvu5jzA">Ravel's piano sonatine</a>-- she just embedded this with a recording of Martha Argerich playing it. Somehow unlike math, mm doesn't practice much piano, (in fact she practices maybe maximum of 4 hours per week when she's supposed to practice 14 hours a week), but she still managed to get distinction for ABRSM grade 8 and is working on dipABRSM, which has a lot of nice pieces in its syllabus.

<h2>MM & My.sources</h2>
psssst this is full of math resources, they aren't actually "mine" but they are sources that I really apprecaite.
<ul>
<li><a href="gmathirl.webflow.io">GmathIRL</a> <br>Quote Serena's GmathIRL section from her website: "GmathIRL helps improve the minds of youths through math courses and competitions held on two discord servers. We've already successfully run one session and the other session is in progress right now. Events such as GAME (a math contest) and Rabbits Hunt are also under planning." MM fully agrees.</li><br>
<li><a href="https://amctrivial.com/">AMC Trivial</a><br> This is a great problem grinding source for grinding Mathcounts, AMC, A(J)MO and IMO problems. It imports the solutions from AoPS Wiki and there are functions like selecting problems from specific topics or subjects.</li><br>
<li><a href="aops.com/ftw/ftw">For the Win</a><br> This is a fun place on aops where you compete with other users by a game of "FTW", the rules are on aops and this is generally used if you want to improve your speed.</li><br>
<li><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/alcumus">Alcumus</a><br> This is a huge problem grinding source if you want to train yourself in accuracy and specific topics like, say, Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion. It is also on aops and uses problems from past contest and AoPS staff.</li><br>
<li><a href="steamforall.org">SteamforAll</a><br> This is a great organization called Steam for All (not a partner, I just like its contests). It has a lot of great events like workshops, mock contests and you can even sign up for the AMCs from there.</li><br>
<li><a href="edx.org">EdX</a> This site called "EdX" is awesome if you want to choose certified courses with professional people from prestigious universities teaching you. It's kind of like open courses, but on a large platform where you can find whatever you want.</li><br>

<h2>MM & reMarks</h2>
:D I don't really know why I made this but thanks Serena! All you need to know is Serena is also referred to as rabbit or 喜羊羊, and she is very 0rz - in fact, she's a MOPper! Also, Serena's discord username is rabbit but you won't know her tag :P

<p>I don't know if you noticed this, but "Small Qiu" actually has a super light pink-purplish background color.</p>

<p>Notice that I didn't mention coding or html here. I'd like to clarify- I do C++ and have just closely missed the USACO Silver cutoff. However, I enjoy math more than informatics so I decided to keep my MM&M number at 4 for now (the perfect square of the only even prime :D). Also, regarding html, I don't do it whatsoever but just learnt the basics for this...thing.</p>

<p>"Qiu" is also part of Confucius' name - Kong Qiu (孔丘).</p>

<p>Here's some good stuff mostly imported from Serena's website: <br>
	"The abbreviation of my Chinese name is lyz." "Oh is that 	老鸭子？" --- Luis Lee and MM <br>
	"Maybe if I beg Serena for 3 days and nights she'll agree." --- me when she wants a picture of 2-year-old Serena
	"Tiny humans" --- a debater one grade higher than me when I managed to get to finals.

<p>At first, I wanted to call this site "hummingbirds" or "humminbird" or something like that, but decided not to after seeing how many hummingbird sites there are already - same thing with cheesestrings.</p>

<p>I decided to name this "small qiu" because Qiu's my last name and I'm small</p>

If you found this you probably know how to reach out to me but if you don't, ask all the competition math students around you whether they know someone called 'mm'.</font></footer>
